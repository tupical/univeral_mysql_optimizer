# Database Optimization SQL Script

## Overview

This repository contains a SQL script designed to optimize the performance of a MariaDB database, achieving up to a 2x speed improvement for queries. The script implements indexing, table optimization, and configuration adjustments to enhance query execution efficiency.

## Features

- **Indexing**: Adds optimized indexes to frequently queried columns to reduce lookup times.
- **Table Optimization**: Reorganizes table structures to eliminate fragmentation and improve access speed.
- **Configuration Tweaks**: Adjusts MariaDB server settings for better resource utilization.

## Prerequisites

- MariaDB 10.5 or higher
- Administrative access to the database
- Basic knowledge of SQL and database administration

## Installation

1. Copy SQL code and execute in your DB

## Usage

1. **Backup your database** before applying any changes to avoid data loss.
2. Open the `optimize.sql` script in your preferred SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver).
3. Modify the script to target your specific tables and columns (see comments in the script for guidance).
4. Execute the script:

   ```sql
   SOURCE optimize.sql;
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database < optimize.sql
   ```


## Performance Improvements

- **Query Speed**: Up to 2x faster query execution for SELECT, JOIN, and WHERE clauses.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced disk I/O and CPU usage due to optimized table structures.
- **Scalability**: Improved performance for large datasets with proper indexing.

## Testing

To verify the performance improvements:

1. Run a benchmark query before applying the script (e.g., `EXPLAIN SELECT ...`).
2. Apply the script.
3. Run the same query again and compare execution times using `EXPLAIN` or `SHOW PROFILE`.
